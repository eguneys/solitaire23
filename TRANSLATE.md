## Contribute Translate

Translations are stored in [content/trans](content/trans). With the format

```
key=value
```
key shouldn't be changed, value should be translated.

To add a new language, copy the english translations at [content/trans/en.trans](content/trans/en.trans) translate the values, and save the file as `language_code.trans`.

Or change an existing translation file.
